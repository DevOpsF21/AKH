Introduction
    The aim of this project is creating a headless care software application for a tertiary care hospital as part of DevOps course project. this system has three man functionality each with it's own designated service endpoint, namely:

    1.	User Authentication
    for the services to be accessed securely users must be registered into the database. Hence, this module is build for user management, including:
        1.1.    Create user and assign them a role
        1.2.	Delete User.
        1.3.    Change password.
        1.4.    Login
        
    2.	Patient Registration.
    this service is built to addess the need to register patients by a clerk and it is has below main sub-modules
        2.1.	Register a patient.
        2.2.	Delete a patient.
        2.3.	List patients (All).
        2.4.	Find a patient by a Patient Number. 
        2.5.	Seach patients by name.
        
    3.	Ward Admission
    Dependency:
    In any health care system, there must be a service to manage inpations. since this is only a course work project, we fisrt created ward details uisng createwards.js. this file was create using ChatGPT since it was not part of the module that was needed as part of the project.
    
    >>> node createwards.js

    assuming that we have the wards details craated as a collection in mngodb as instructed above, this module can be accessed by 3 different roles each with their own set of functionalities:
    3.1.    Admin Role
        1.	Admit a patient.
        2.  View inpatients that need to be discharged
        3.	Discharge a patient.
    3.2.    Nurse Role
        3.	View patients in inpatient section (wards)
        4.	View & add vital signs including heart health (rates & pulse), blood pressure & temperature.
        5.	View & add medications.
        6.	View & add reports.
    3.3.    Doctor role
        7.	Add discharge form.

Usage:
1. Clone the repository:
    git clone https://github.com/DevOpsF21/DEVOPSCW.git

2. Install Dependencies
rout management
    npm install express
connection to mongodb database
    npm install mangoose
environment management
    npm install dotenv
authentication
    npm install jsonwebtoken
encryption 
    npm install bcrypt

3. Running Services:
    Open terminal and start services:

    To start the authentication service on port 3000:
    npm run authstart

    To start the registration service on port 8080:
    npm run regstart

    To start the ward service on port 9191:
    npm run wardstartnew

4. Setting up User Accounts:
Access http://localhost:3000/v1/user
Add the following JSON to the request body:
    {
    "username":"test",
    "email": "test@gmail.com",
    "password":"test@1234",
    "roles":["nurse"]

    }
In the response, you will receive an Auth token. Copy the token.
